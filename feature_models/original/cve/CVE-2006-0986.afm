# vul_description: WordPress 2.0.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request to (1) default_filters.php, (2) template_loader.php, (3) rss_functions.php, (4) locale.php, (5) wp_db.php, and (6) kses.php in the wp_includes/ directory; and (7) edit_form_advanced.php, (8) admin_functions.php, (9) edit_link_form.php, (10) edit_page_form.php, (11) admin_footer.php, and (12) menu.php in the wp_admin directory; and possibly (13) list directory contents of the wp_includes directory.  NOTE: the vars.php, edit_form.php, wp_settings.php, and edit_form_comment.php vectors are already covered by CVE_2005_4463.  The menu_header.php vector is already covered by CVE_2005_2110.  Other vectors might be covered by CVE_2005_1688.  NOTE: if the typical installation of WordPress does not list any site_specific files to wp_includes, then vector [13] is not an exposure.
