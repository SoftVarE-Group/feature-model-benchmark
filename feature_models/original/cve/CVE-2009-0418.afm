# vul_description: The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) implementation in HP HP_UX B.11.11, B.11.23, and B.11.31 does not validate the origin of Neighbor Discovery messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loss of connectivity), read private network traffic, and possibly execute arbitrary code via a spoofed message that modifies the Forward Information Base (FIB), a related issue to CVE_2008_2476.
