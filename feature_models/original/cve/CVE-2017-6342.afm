# vul_description: An issue was discovered on Dahua DHI_HCVR7216A_S3 devices with NVR Firmware 3.210.0001.10 2016_06_06, Camera Firmware 2.400.0000.28.R 2016_03_29, and SmartPSS Software 1.16.1 2017_01_19. When SmartPSS Software is launched, while on the login screen, the software in the background automatically logs in as admin. This allows sniffing sensitive information identified in CVE_2017_6341 without prior knowledge of the password. This is a different vulnerability than CVE_2013_6117.
