# vul_description: Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 and earlier on Linux allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client crash) via an IFRAME element with a large value of the WIDTH attribute, which triggers a problem related to representation of floating_point numbers, leading to an infinite loop of widget resizes and a corresponding large number of function calls on the stack.
