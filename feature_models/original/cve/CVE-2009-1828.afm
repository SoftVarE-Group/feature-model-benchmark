# vul_description: Mozilla Firefox 3.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop, application hang, and memory consumption) via a KEYGEN element in conjunction with (1) a META element specifying automatic page refresh or (2) a JavaScript onLoad event handler for a BODY element. NOTE: it was later reported that earlier versions are also affected.
