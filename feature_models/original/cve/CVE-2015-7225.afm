# vul_description: Tinfoil Devise_two_factor before 2.0.0 does not strictly follow section 5.2 of RFC 6238 and does not "burn" a successfully validated one_time password (aka OTP), which allows remote or physically proximate attackers with a target user's login credentials to log in as said user by obtaining the OTP through performing a man_in_the_middle attack between the provider and verifier, or shoulder surfing, and replaying the OTP in the current time_step.
