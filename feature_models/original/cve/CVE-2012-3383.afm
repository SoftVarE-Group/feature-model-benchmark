# vul_description: The map_meta_cap function in wp_includes/capabilities.php in WordPress 3.4.x before 3.4.2, when the multisite feature is enabled, does not properly assign the unfiltered_html capability, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and conduct cross_site scripting (XSS) attacks by leveraging the Administrator or Editor role and composing crafted text.
