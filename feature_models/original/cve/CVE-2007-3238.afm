# vul_description: Cross_site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in functions.php in the default theme in WordPress 2.2 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the PATH_INFO (REQUEST_URI) to wp_admin/themes.php, a different vulnerability than CVE_2007_1622.  NOTE: this might not cross privilege boundaries in some configurations, since the Administrator role has the unfiltered_html capability.
