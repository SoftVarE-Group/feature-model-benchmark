# vul_description: OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a pre_authentication integer overflow if a client or server is configured to use a crafted XMSS key. This leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.
