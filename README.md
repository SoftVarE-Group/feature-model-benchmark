# Feature-Model Benchmark

## Introduction

Our feature-model benchmark (FMB) provides large, real-world feature models for empirical evaluations.
All currently available feature models, including characteristis and their sources, are shown in a table at the bottom.
We offer additional functionality to make use of the FMB more convenient. 
Users can search for FMs, log their search results, create their own FMBs from search results or config-files, and translate their results into different formats.

## Search Procedure

Search is provided by a Python-script written in Python version 10.8. 
The script relies almost exclusively on Python core-functionality. 
The few cases in which it doesn't are specifically indicated and users only need to install the libraries if they want to use the advanced functionality.

### Preliminary Steps

The following functionality is provided by the `scripts/fmb_search.py` file, which can be started by
 1. Cloning the repository
 2. Navigating to the "scripts"-directory
 3. `python fmb_search.py`

You can search for FMs with specific characteristics in the categories
 - Domain
 - Format
 - Features
 - CTC

### Basic Search

The basic principle behind search is that the user enters the search categories before entering the search values
(e.g., first that they are searching for "domain", then they want domain "finance").

The search procedure offers three choices:
 1. Search for a single category
 	1. Enter 1 category
	2. Press Enter
	3. Enter the search value
	4. Press Enter
	5. Resulting FMs are shown
 2. Search for multiple categories looking for an intersection of sets of FMs (logical AND)
	1. Enter at least 2 categories and separate them by comma or ampersand
	2. Press Enter
	3. Enter the search value, separating the search values by comma or ampersand
	4. Press Enter
	5. Resulting FMs fulfilling all criteria are shown
 3. Search for multiple categories looking for a union of sets of FMs (logical OR)
 	1. Enter at least 2 categories and separate them by semicolon or pipe
	2. Press Enter
	3. Enter the search value, separating the search values by semicolon or pipe
	4. Press Enter
	5. Resulting FMs fulfilling at least one of the criteria are shown

(When entering categories "domain" or "format", the available items are printed to the console)

Basic-Search Examples:
 1. Find all FMs of domain "automotive": 
	- *Enter* `domain` *and then* `automotive`
 2. Find FMs with domain "systems software" and format "FeatureIDE": 
	- *Enter* `domain,format` *and then* `systems software,FeatureIDE`
	- *Enter* `domain&format` *and then* `systems software&FeatureIDE`
 3. Find all FMs with either domain "systems software" or format "FeatureIDE": 
	- *Enter* `domain;format` *and then* `systems software;FeatureIDE`
	- *Enter* `domain|format` *and then* `systems software|FeatureIDE`

#### Special Search Operations

The special search operators are only to be used in search values, not categories.
The first 3 improve search for categories with numerical values (features, CTCs)
 1. Greater than: >"Number"
 2. Less than:    <"Number"
 3. Range:        "Number"to"Number", "Number"-"Number", "Number".."Number"
 4. NOT:          -"Value"
 
 (large numbers can be more shortly written by substituting "000" or "000000" with "k" or "m",
 for example, "50k" instead of "50000")
 
Examples:
 1. Find all FMs of domain "finance" with more than 700 features: 
	- *Enter* `domain,features` *and then* `finance,>700`
 2. Find all FMs of domain "finance" with fewer than 700 features: 
	- *Enter* `domain,features` *and then* `finance,<700`
 3. Find FMs of domain "business" or with more than 70,000 features: 
	- *Enter* `domain;features` *and then* `business;>70000`
	- *Enter* `domain|features` *and then* `business|>70k`
 4. Find FMs of domain "systems software" or with 1000 to 2000 features: 
	- *Enter* `domain,features` *and then* `systems software,1000..2000`	
 5. Find FMs of domain "systems software" but not in format "DIMACS":
	- *Enter* `domain,features` *and then* `systems software,-DIMACS`
 6. Find FMs of domain "business" or not in format "DIMACS":
	- *Enter* `domain;format` *and then* `business;-DIMACS`

Get all available FMs:
 - Commands: Nothing (i.e., just press "Enter"), all
 - To save all available FMs in a new subdirectory of benchmarks:
   1. `fmb`
   2. "Enter"
   3. "Enter"

Additional commands:
 - `help`
 - `exit`
 - `show domains`
 - `show formats`
 - `show features`
 - `show ctc`
 
Get statistics (show features, show ctc) for current FM search:
 - Add "+s" to category
 - Example: `features+s`
 
#### Modification and Reading of Files and Directories

Users can create their own FM-benchmarks, store information about FMBs and read config-files to reproduce the FMB decribed therein. 
In addition, information about FMs can be translated into different formats.

##### Create Own Feature-Model Benchmark

You can create your own FMB from FMs found during search by storing the FM-files in a new directory.
If the "benchmarks"-directory not yet exists, it's automatically created next to "scripts" etc.,
and the FMs are stored in a subdirectory of it.

Create your own FMB:
 - Commands: `fmb`, `create benchmark`
 - Example:
   1. `fmb`
   2. `dom`
   3. `finance`

##### Config-File to Log Info about FMB

You can create a config-file to store information about experiments and the used FMBs.
The config-file is stored in the "configs"-directory and offers 2 possibilities:
 - Config with FMs only
 - Config with additional information
 
The FMs are stored as strings of dictionaries in a txt-file.

Create configs-file with information about experiments:
 - Commands:
   - Without additional information: `log`, `conf`
   - With additional information:    `log(name;analysis;ARE;publication)`
	 - You can add additional information to every configs-command
	 - Always open and close parentheses
	 - Separator inside is semicolon
	 - Not all 4 categories have to be provided, but always 3 semicolons
	 - If a category contains more than 1 value, separate these values by comma
 - Examples:
   - Without additional information:
     1. `log`
	 2. `dom`
	 3. `finance`
   - With additional information (providing no publication):
     1. `log(Test;Validation;Sat4J,Choco;)`
	 2. `dom`
	 3. `finance`

##### Config-File and FMB Together

A config-file can be created together with a FMB by concatenating the commands with "+".
In this special case, a new subdirectory is created in "configs"-directory,
storing the config-file and a subdirectory with the FMs.

Create Config and FMB:
 - New subdirectory in "configs"-directory containing
   - Config txt-file
   - Subdirectory: 
     - FMB with files of found FMs
 - Commands:
   - Without additional information: `fmb+log`
   - With additional information:    `fmb+log(name;analysis;ARE;publication)`
   
##### FMB from Config-File

Users can create a FMB from a config-file under the following conditions:
 - Config-file is in "configs"-directory
 - FMs are stored as strings of dictionaries (one per line)
 - Only FMs are allowed to start with "{'" (open curly brace followed by single quotation mark)
 
Create FMB from existing Config:
 - Write: command + whitespace + filename (adding txt-file extension optional)
 - Commands: `read config`, `rc`
 - Example: `rc testconfig.txt`
 - FMB is created in "benchmarks"-directory

##### Translation of Feature-Model Information

Information about FMs is provided as strings of dictionaries,
but they can be translated to other formats.
Note that for 2 formats, extra libraries are necessary.

Translate FMs to different format:
 - Write: command + whitespace + (filename +) whitespace + format
 - Commands: `translate`, `trans`, `t`
 - Currently supported formats: CSV, JSON, XML, YAML
 - 2 FM sources:
   1. FM search
      - If no filename is given, the FMs found during the current search are used
	  - Example:
	    1. `trans json`
		2. `dom`
		3. `finance`
   2. File in "configs"-directory
      - If a filename is given, the FMs are extracted from it and the program exits
	  - Example:
	    1. `trans config_filename csv`
 - Translated FMs are stored in a file of the specified format stored in configs-directory
 - Filename of file with translated FMs begins with "tlconfig" ("tl" for "translate")
 - Note that both, XML and YAML, need extra libraries to work
   - XML
     - Library: dicttoxml
	 - Install: pip install dicttoxml
   - YAML
     - Library: PyYAML
	 - Install: pip install pyyaml

## Command-Line Arguments

The search can be executed via command-line arguments and supports a lot of the functionality of the full script.
Users can search for FMs, create config-files, FMBs, config-files and FMBs, and translate FMs.
	
Usage with command-line arguments:
 - 3 types of arguments are optional (in the following order):
   1. Categories:               `--cat`
   2. Values: 				    `--val`
   3. Config, FMB, translation: `--cft`
      - allows 4 different values:
	    - `log`
		- `fmb`
		- `fmb+log`
		- `format` (from list of formats to translate into)
 - Categories only work with values
 - Closes after execution
 - Example:
   1. `python fmb_search.py --cat dom --val finance --cft log+fmb`
   2. `python fmb_search.py --cat dom,feat --val "finance,>700" --cft log+fmb`
   3. `python fmb_search.py --cat dom,feat --val "finance,>700" --cft json`
   
   (note the quotation marks around `"finance,>700"` because of ">" to avoid errors)
